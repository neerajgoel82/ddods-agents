## 🆕 Advanced Techniques Overview

The article introduces **six advanced techniques** that make AI agents more robust, dynamic, and adaptable:

1. **Guardrails** → Enforcing constraints to ensure agents produce reliable and expected outputs
2. **Referencing other Tasks and their outputs** → Allowing agents to dynamically use previous task results
3. **Executing tasks async** → Running agent tasks concurrently to optimize performance
4. **Adding callbacks** → Allowing post-processing or monitoring of task completions
5. **Human-in-the-loop during execution** → Introducing human-in-the-loop mechanisms for validation and control
6. **Hierarchical Agentic processes** → Structuring agents into sub-agents and multi-level execution trees

## 🛡️ Guardrails - Enforcing Constraints

### **The Problem**
AI agents are powerful, but without constraints and safeguards, they can hallucinate, enter infinite loops, or make unreliable decisions. Guardrails ensure that agents stay on track and maintain quality standards.

### **Core Implementation**

**Guardrail Function Structure:**
```python
def validate_summary_length(task_output):
    try:
        task_str_output = str(task_output)
        total_words = len(task_str_output.split())
        
        if total_words > 150:
            return (False, f"Summary exceeds 150 words. Current Word count: {total_words}")
        
        if total_words == 0:
            return (False, "Generated summary is empty.")
        
        return (True, task_output)
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, f"Validation system error: {str(e)}")
```

**Key Requirements:**
- **Return Format:** Must return a tuple of two values
  - **First value (Boolean):** `True` for success, `False` for failure
  - **Second value:** Either the validated result (if successful) or error message (if failed)
- **Single Parameter:** Accept only the agent's output
- **Clear Error Messages:** Provide specific feedback for AI to improve subsequent attempts

### **Automatic Retry Mechanism**

When a guardrail returns `(False, error_message)`:
1. Error message is sent to the Agent
2. Agent considers the error message to fix the failure cause
3. Process repeats until error is fixed: `(True, task_output)`
4. Or until maximum retries reached (default: 3, configurable via `max_retries`)

### **Advanced Use Cases**

**1. Summary Length Validation:**
- Ensure summaries stay under 150 words
- Prevent empty outputs
- Provide word count feedback for refinement

**2. Structured Output Validation:**
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ResearchReport(BaseModel):
    title: str
    summary: str
    key_findings: list[str]

def validate_json_report(task_output):
    try:
        # JSON validation logic
        if json_structure_correct:
            return (True, task_output)
        else:
            return (False, "Missing required fields...")
    except:
        return (False, "Invalid JSON format.")
```

**3. Content-Specific Constraints:**
- Social media character limits (Twitter: 280 characters)
- Data format validation (JSON, CSV structure)
- Fact-checking outputs for accuracy

### **Best Practices for Guardrails**
- **Clear Error Messages:** Instead of "Output is invalid," provide specific guidance
- **Critical Applications:** Always apply guardrails where AI errors can cause serious problems
- **Retry Limits:** Set maximum retry limits to prevent wasting API calls and compute power
- **Validation Scope:** Apply to data validation, content constraints, and fact-checking scenarios

## 🔗 Task Output Referencing

### **The Concept**
Tasks can reference previous task outputs to create context-aware AI workflows, enabling agents to dynamically use outputs from previous tasks instead of working in isolation.

### **TaskOutput Object Structure**

Each task in CrewAI produces an output automatically stored as a `TaskOutput` object:

```python
TaskOutput(
    description='Summarize a research topic in 150 words.',
    name=None,
    expected_output='A concise research summary 150 words.',
    summary='Summarize a research topic in 150 words....',
    raw="""Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of 
           deep learning models primarily used for image 
           processing and computer vision ...""",
    pydantic=None,
    json_dict=None,
    agent='Summary Agent',
    output_format=<OutputFormat.RAW: 'raw'>
)
```

**Key Fields:**
- **`description`** → The task description
- **`summary`** → First 10 words of the description
- **`raw`** → Raw AI-generated output
- **`pydantic`** → A structured Pydantic model output (if any)
- **`json_dict`** → A JSON dictionary output
- **and more**

### **Implementation Patterns**

**1. Sequential Task Dependencies:**
```python
# Step 1: Research Task
research_task = Task(
    description="Find and summarize the latest AI advancements",
    expected_output="A structured list of recent AI breakthroughs",
    agent=research_agent,
    output_pydantic=ResearchFindings
)

# Step 2: Analysis Task (depends on research)
analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze AI research findings and extract key insights",
    expected_output="A structured summary with key takeaways",
    agent=analysis_agent,
    output_pydantic=AnalysisSummary,
    context=[research_task]  # References research output
)

# Step 3: Blog Writing Task (depends on both)
blog_writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a detailed blog post about AI trends",
    expected_output="A well-structured blog post",
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_task, analysis_task]  # Uses both outputs
)
```

**2. Default Task Referencing:**
By default, a task always references the output of the previous task. Explicit `context=[research_task]` is optional for sequential dependencies but required for multi-task contexts.

### **Benefits of Task Referencing**
- **Context-Aware Decision Making:** Tasks build on prior results rather than starting fresh
- **Avoid Redundant AI Generations:** Reuse previous task results instead of regenerating
- **Pass Structured Data:** JSON/Pydantic models between tasks for better accuracy
- **Multi-Step Complex Workflows:** Enable sophisticated pipelines like Research → Analysis → Blog Writing

### **Practical Example: Multi-Step AI Pipeline**

**Workflow:** Research AI trends → Analyze findings → Generate blog post

**Output Flow:**
1. **Research findings** gathered first
2. **Analysis agent** extracts insights from research
3. **Blog writer** creates complete post using both research and summary as inputs

**Result:** Each agent contributes specialized expertise while building on previous work, creating higher-quality final outputs than any single agent could produce.

## ⚡ Asynchronous Task Execution

### **The Problem with Sequential Execution**
Traditional task execution runs sequentially—one task must finish before the next begins. This is inefficient when:
- Some tasks take longer than others (web scraping, deep research)
- Tasks can run independently without affecting each other
- We need to maximize efficiency by running tasks in parallel

### **Asynchronous Solution**
Asynchronous execution allows multiple tasks to run in parallel, reducing overall execution time.

**Example Scenario:**
- **Sequential:** Research AI breakthroughs (5 min) → Analyze regulations (5 min) = **10 minutes total**
- **Asynchronous:** Research breakthroughs + Analyze regulations simultaneously = **5 minutes total**

### **Implementation**

```python
# Task 1: AI Breakthroughs Research (Asynchronous)
research_ai_task = Task(
    description="""Research the latest AI advancements 
                   and summarize key breakthroughs.""",
    expected_output="A structured list of AI breakthroughs.",
    agent=research_agent,
    output_pydantic=AIResearchFindings,
    async_execution=True  # Enable parallel execution
)

# Task 2: AI Regulation Analysis (Asynchronous)
research_regulation_task = Task(
    description="""Analyze the latest AI regulations 
                   worldwide and summarize key policies.""",
    expected_output="A structured summary of AI regulations by region.",
    agent=regulation_agent,
    output_pydantic=AIRegulationFindings,
    async_execution=True  # Run simultaneously with Task 1
)

# Task 3: Generate AI Research Report (Sequential - waits for both)
generate_report_task = Task(
    description="Write a report summarizing AI breakthroughs and regulations.",
    expected_output="A final AI report summarizing both aspects.",
    agent=writer_agent,
    output_pydantic=FinalAIReport,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_regulation_task]  # Waits for both
)
```

### **Execution Flow**
1. **Tasks 1 & 2** execute simultaneously (`async_execution=True`)
2. **Task 3** waits for both Tasks 1 & 2 to complete before starting
3. **Total time** = Time of longest task + Task 3 time (not sum of all tasks)

### **Comparison: Async vs Sequential**

**Without Async (`async_execution=False`):**
- AI Researcher Agent executes first
- AI Policy Analyst executes after Researcher completes
- **Sequential execution order**

**With Async (`async_execution=True`):**
- Both agents execute simultaneously
- Report writer waits for both to complete
- **Parallel execution with final synthesis**

---

## 📞 Task Callbacks

### **Purpose**
Task callbacks enable triggering additional actions once a task is completed, such as:
- Store results in a database or file for further processing
- Trigger another process (like running a Python script)
- Send notifications or alerts
- Log task completion details

### **Implementation Example**

**Callback Function Definition:**
```python
def notify_team(output):
    print(f"""Task Completed!
    Task: {output.description}
    Output Summary: {output.summary}""")
    
    with open("latest_ai_news.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(f"Task: {output.description}\n")
        f.write(f"Output Summary: {output.summary}\n")
        f.write(f"Full Output: {output.raw}\n")
    
    print("News summary saved to latest_ai_news.txt")
```

**Task with Callback:**
```python
research_news_task = Task(
    description="Find and summarize the latest AI breakthroughs",
    expected_output="A structured summary of AI news headlines.",
    agent=research_agent,
    callback=notify_team  # Automatic execution after task completion
)
```

### **Execution Flow**
1. **Research task executes normally**
2. **Task completes successfully**
3. **Callback function automatically runs** with task output
4. **Notification printed** and **results saved to file**

**Example Output:**
```
Task Completed!
Task: Find and summarize the latest AI breakthroughs from the last week.
Output Summary: Find and summarize the latest AI breakthroughs from the last...
News summary saved to latest_ai_news.txt
```

### **Advanced Use Cases**
- **News Monitoring System:** Automatically save AI research summaries
- **Database Integration:** Store structured results in production databases
- **Notification Systems:** Alert teams when critical tasks complete
- **Workflow Triggers:** Start follow-up processes based on task completion

## 💻 Implementation Examples

### **Example 1: Guardrails in Action**

**Scenario:** Ensure research summaries stay under 150 words and are not empty.

```python
from crewai import Task, Agent

summary_agent = Agent(
    role="Summary Agent",
    goal="""Summarize the research paper 
    'Convolutional Neural Networks' in 150 words.""",
    backstory="You specialize in summarizing research papers.",
    verbose=True
)

summary_task = Task(
    description="Summarize a research paper in 150 words.",
    expected_output="A concise research summary 150 words.",
    agent=summary_agent,
    guardrail=validate_summary_length,  # Apply guardrail
)
```

**When guardrail validation fails:** Agent automatically retries with error feedback until successful or max retries reached.

### **Example 2: Multi-Step Workflow with Structured Outputs**

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

# Define structured output models
class ResearchFindings(BaseModel):
    title: str
    key_findings: list[str]

class AnalysisSummary(BaseModel):
    insights: list[str]
    key_takeaways: str

class BlogPost(BaseModel):
    title: str
    content: str
    summary: str

# Create agents with specific roles
research_agent = Agent(
    role="AI Researcher",
    goal="Find and summarize the latest AI advancements",
    backstory="An expert AI researcher who tracks technological advancements.",
    verbose=True,
)

analysis_agent = Agent(
    role="AI Analyst", 
    goal="Analyze AI research findings and extract key insights",
    backstory="A data analyst who extracts valuable insights from research data.",
    verbose=True,
)

writer_agent = Agent(
    role="Tech Writer",
    goal="Write well-structured blog post on AI trends",
    backstory="A technology writer skilled at transforming complex AI research into readable content.",
    verbose=True,
)

# Create interdependent tasks
research_task = Task(
    description="Find and summarize the latest AI advancement",
    expected_output="A structured list of recent AI breakthroughs",
    agent=research_agent,
    output_pydantic=ResearchFindings
)

analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze AI research findings and extract key insights",
    expected_output="A structured summary with key takeaways",
    agent=analysis_agent,
    output_pydantic=AnalysisSummary,
    context=[research_task]  # Uses research output
)

blog_writing_task = Task(
    description="Write a detailed blog post about AI trends",
    expected_output="A well-structured blog post",
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_task, analysis_task]  # Uses both outputs
)

# Execute workflow
ai_research_crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, analysis_agent, writer_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, analysis_task, blog_writing_task],
    verbose=True
)

result = ai_research_crew.kickoff()
```

### **Example 3: Asynchronous Execution with Callbacks**

```python
# Asynchronous research tasks
research_ai_task = Task(
    description="Research the latest AI advancements and summarize key breakthroughs",
    expected_output="A structured list of AI breakthroughs",
    agent=research_agent,
    output_pydantic=AIResearchFindings,
    async_execution=True  # Run in parallel
)

research_regulation_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the latest AI regulations worldwide and summarize key policies",
    expected_output="A structured summary of AI regulations by region",
    agent=regulation_agent,
    output_pydantic=AIRegulationFindings,
    async_execution=True,  # Run in parallel
    callback=notify_team  # Notification on completion
)

# Final synthesis task
generate_report_task = Task(
    description="Write a report summarizing AI breakthroughs and regulations",
    expected_output="A final AI report summarizing both aspects",
    agent=writer_agent,
    output_pydantic=FinalAIReport,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_regulation_task]
)
```

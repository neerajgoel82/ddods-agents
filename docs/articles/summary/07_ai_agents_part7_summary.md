## üÜï New Concepts Beyond Parts 1-6

### **Knowledge vs. Tools: The Critical Distinction**

While previous parts focused on tools and workflows, Part 7 introduces a fundamental concept that hadn't been deeply explored:

**Tools vs. Knowledge Sources:**
- **Tools** ‚Üí Perform actions (web search, file reading, API calls)
- **Knowledge** ‚Üí Provide reference context for reasoning (PDFs, CSVs, docs, preloaded text)

**Key Differences:**

| Aspect | Tools | Knowledge |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Primary Role** | Perform an action | Provide reference context for reasoning |
| **Invocation** | Explicitly called by the agent | Implicitly accessed via semantic retrieval |
| **Samples** | Web search, file reader, API calls | PDFs, CSVs, docs, preloaded text |
| **Example** | "Go fetch this from the web" | "Use what you already know to answer this question" |
| **Execution Time** | Happens live during the agent's run | Preprocessed and stored prior to task execution |

## üìö Knowledge Source Implementation

### **1. String Knowledge Sources**

**Purpose:** Lightweight in-memory knowledge for small amounts of structured or unstructured information.

**Implementation:**
```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.string_knowledge_source import StringKnowledgeSource

# Define knowledge as raw string
policy_text = """
Our return policy allows customers to return any product within 30 days of purchase. 
Refunds will be issued only if the item is unused and in original packaging.
Customers must provide proof of purchase when requesting a return.
"""

# Create knowledge source
return_policy_knowledge = StringKnowledgeSource(content=policy_text)
```

**Use Cases:**
- Company policies and procedures
- FAQ content
- Product specifications
- Quick reference information

### **2. File-Based Knowledge Sources**

**Supported Formats:**
- **Text files (.txt)**
- **PDFs**
- **Markdown (.md)**
- **CSV/Excel spreadsheets**
- **JSON files**
- **Custom APIs**
- **Raw strings**

**Implementation Examples:**

**Text Files:**
```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.text_file_knowledge_source import TextFileKnowledgeSource

text_source = TextFileKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["hr_policy.txt"]
)
```

**PDF Files:**
```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.pdf_knowledge_source import PDFKnowledgeSource

pdf_source = PDFKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["meeting_notes.pdf"]
)
```

**CSV Files:**
```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.csv_knowledge_source import CSVKnowledgeSource

csv_source = CSVKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["feedback.csv"]
)
```

**JSON Files:**
```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.json_knowledge_source import JSONKnowledgeSource

json_source = JSONKnowledgeSource(
    file_paths=["company_info.json"]
)
```

## üîß Advanced Knowledge Features

### **Chunking Configuration**

**Purpose:** Control how large documents are broken down for optimal retrieval.

```python
source = StringKnowledgeSource(
    content="Your content here",
    chunk_size=4000,        # Maximum size of each chunk (default: 4000)
    chunk_overlap=200       # Overlap between chunks (default: 200)
)
```

**Chunking Benefits:**
- Ensures text fits the input size of embedding models
- Prevents single embedding for entire documents
- Maintains semantic continuity between chunks
- Enables more precise context retrieval

### **Knowledge Access Levels**

**Agent-Level Access:**
```python
agent = Agent(
    role="Product Launch Specialist",
    knowledge_sources=[product_knowledge],  # Only this agent has access
    ...
)
```

**Crew-Level Access:**
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[marketing_agent, support_agent],
    tasks=[marketing_task, support_task],
    knowledge_sources=[product_knowledge],  # All agents have access
    ...
)
```

**Design Philosophy:** Mirrors real-world information flow where some documents are confidential to specific team members, while others are shared across teams.

## üõ†Ô∏è Custom Knowledge Sources

### **Creating Custom Knowledge Sources**

**Use Case:** When data comes from live APIs, databases, or internal systems rather than static files.

**Example: Weather Knowledge Source**

```python
from crewai.knowledge.source.base_knowledge_source import BaseKnowledgeSource
from typing import Dict, Any
from pydantic import Field
import requests

class WeatherKnowledgeSource(BaseKnowledgeSource):
    city: str = Field(description="City for which weather should be fetched")
    
    def load_content(self) -> Dict[Any, str]:
        # Make API call to weather service
        endpoint = "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast"
        params = {
            "latitude": 37.77,    # San Francisco coordinates
            "longitude": -122.42,
            "current_weather": True
        }
        
        response = requests.get(endpoint, params=params)
        response.raise_for_status()
        weather_data = response.json().get("current_weather", {})
        
        # Format data for embedding
        formatted = self.format_weather(weather_data)
        return {self.city: formatted}
    
    def format_weather(self, data: dict) -> str:
        if not data:
            return "No weather data available."
        
        return (
            f"Current weather in {self.city}:\n"
            f"- Temperature: {data.get('temperature')}¬∞C\n"
            f"- Wind Speed: {data.get('windspeed')} km/h\n"
            f"- Weather Code: {data.get('weathercode')}\n"
            f"- Time: {data.get('time')}"
        )
    
    def add(self) -> None:
        content = self.load_content()
        for _, text in content.items():
            chunks = self._chunk_text(text)
            self.chunks.extend(chunks)
        self._save_documents()
```

**Key Methods:**
- **`load_content()`**: Required method that returns dictionary of text content to embed
- **`add()`**: Method to handle preprocessing (chunking and saving)
- **Custom processing**: Format data into embeddable text

## üîí Embedding Customization

### **Privacy and Performance Optimization**

**Problem:** By default, CrewAI uses the same provider for both LLM generation and embeddings, but you might want different providers for:
- Privacy (local embeddings with Ollama)
- Performance (faster/cheaper embedding models)
- Domain-specific encoding

**Solution: Custom Embedding Configuration**

**Step 1: Set up local embedding model**
```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

**Step 2: Configure Ollama embedder**
```python
from crewai import LLM

# Configure Ollama for embeddings
ollama_embedder = {
    "provider": "ollama",
    "config": {
        "model": "nomic-embed-text",
        "api_url": "http://localhost:11434"
    }
}
```

**Step 3: Use custom embedder with crew**
```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[hr_faq_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    knowledge_sources=[faq_knowledge],
    embedder=ollama_embedder,  # Custom embedding configuration
    process=Process.sequential,
    verbose=True
)
```

**Supported Embedding Providers:**
- **openai** (OpenAI embeddings)
- **google** (Google embeddings)  
- **cohere** (Cohere embeddings)
- **huggingface** (HuggingFace models)
- **azure** (Azure OpenAI)
- **AWS bedrock** (Amazon Bedrock)
- **ollama** (Local models)

### **Benefits of Embedding Customization**
- **Privacy**: Run entirely on-premises with Ollama
- **Cost optimization**: Use cheaper embedding models while keeping premium LLMs
- **Performance**: Optimize embedding models for specific data types
- **Domain specialization**: Use embeddings trained on domain-specific data

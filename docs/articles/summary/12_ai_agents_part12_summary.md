## 🎯 Executive Summary

Part 12 demonstrates how to implement the **Multi-agent Pattern from scratch** using pure Python and LLMs, without relying on high-level frameworks like CrewAI or LangChain. This article builds upon the ReAct and Planning patterns by showing how to coordinate multiple specialized agents working together in a controlled pipeline.

## 🆕 New Concepts Beyond Parts 1-11

### **From Single-Agent to Multi-Agent Coordination**

While Parts 1-11 covered various agent capabilities and frameworks, Part 12 introduces the fundamental challenge of **agent coordination**:

**The Core Problem:**
- Individual agents (ReAct, Planning) work in isolation
- Real-world tasks require **multiple specialists** working together
- Need for **structured handoffs** between agents with different roles and tools

**Multi-Agent Solution:**
- **Specialized agents** with focused roles and limited toolsets
- **Sequential pipeline** where each agent's output becomes the next agent's input
- **Crew orchestration** that manages dependencies and execution order

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture: Three Core Components

### **1. Tool Class - Enhanced Function Wrapper**

**Purpose:** Wrap Python functions with metadata and validation for agent consumption.

**Key Features:**
- **FunctionSignature extraction** using Python's `inspect` module
- **ArgumentValidator** for type checking and parameter validation
- **Structured JSON output** for agent tool discovery
- **Automatic input validation** with error handling

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
@tool
def lookup_weather(city: str, units: str = "Celsius") -> str:
    """Gets the weather in a city."""
```

**Tool Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Metadata Extraction:** Function name, parameters, types, defaults, docstring
2. **Validation Setup:** Type coercion and required parameter checking
3. **Agent Integration:** JSON tool descriptions for LLM consumption
4. **Execution Wrapper:** Safe function calls with validated inputs

### **2. Agent Class - Individual AI Workers**

**Purpose:** Autonomous AI units that can reason, act with tools, and pass results to other agents.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **ReAct-based reasoning** when tools are available
- **Simple LLM responses** when no tools needed
- **Context handling** from upstream agents
- **Structured output generation** for downstream agents

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Name:** For identification and dependency wiring
- **Backstory:** System prompt for role personality
- **Task Description:** Specific responsibilities
- **Tool List:** Limited, role-appropriate capabilities
- **LLM Backend:** Configurable model selection

**Execution Flow:**
1. **Prompt Construction:** Combine role, task, context, and available tools
2. **ReAct Loop:** If tools available, use structured reasoning cycle
3. **Tool Execution:** Parse and execute tool calls with validation
4. **Output Generation:** Produce results for next agent or final response

### **3. Crew Class - Multi-Agent Orchestrator**

**Purpose:** Workflow manager that coordinates multiple agents in the correct execution order.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- **Agent Registration:** Self-registration system using context managers
- **Dependency Resolution:** Topological sorting to determine execution order
- **Context Management:** Pass outputs between dependent agents
- **Error Handling:** Graceful failure management across the pipeline

**Orchestration Process:**
1. **Agent Discovery:** Automatic registration when agents are created within Crew context
2. **Dependency Analysis:** Build execution graph based on agent dependencies
3. **Topological Sort:** Ensure agents run in correct order (A → B → C)
4. **Sequential Execution:** Run each agent with appropriate context
5. **Output Aggregation:** Collect and return final results

## 🔄 Multi-Agent Execution Pattern

### **Sequential Pipeline Design**

**Example Workflow:** Number Processing Pipeline
- **Agent A:** Doubles the number 4 → outputs 8
- **Agent B:** Takes 8 as context, squares it → outputs 64

**Dependency Declaration:**
```python
# Agent B depends on Agent A
agent_b.depends_on(agent_a)
```

**Automatic Context Passing:**
```python
# Agent B automatically receives Agent A's output as context
context_messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Previous result: {agent_a_output}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": agent_b_task}
]
```

### **Topological Sorting Implementation**

**Challenge:** Ensure agents execute in dependency order
**Solution:** Classic computer science topological sort algorithm

**Process:**
1. **In-degree Calculation:** Count dependencies for each agent
2. **Queue Initialization:** Start with agents having zero dependencies  
3. **Sequential Processing:** Execute ready agents, update dependency counts
4. **Cycle Detection:** Prevent infinite loops from circular dependencies
